    "Let the continuous random variable D denote the diameter of the hole drilled in an aluminum sheet. The target diameter to be achieved is 12.5mm. Random disturbances in the process often result in inaccuracy. Historical data shows that the distribution of D can be modelled by the PDF, f(d) = 20e−20(d−12.5), d ≥ 12.5. If a part with diameter > 12.6 mm needs to be scrapped, what is the proportion of those parts? What is the CDF when the diameter is of 11 mm? What is the conclusion of this experiment?\n",
